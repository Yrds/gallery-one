Gallery One is a simple to use framework agnostic gallery component.

* **Simple to use:** Place some HTMLs and constructor the gallery object.
* **Responsiveness and Mobile support:** Gallery One aims to work on most of browsers and different type os displays.
* **Works on Internet explorer 11:** Firstly I made this component because I didn't find any component that works on older browsers, so I did myself.
